# What's this

This is a directory containing one or more documents that can be copied to new repositories whenever you want to use a coding agent to bootstrap a new project based on this architecture, coding style and toolchain.

After you create the base application using `pnpm create next-app@latest my-app --yes
` or equivalent, tell the agent to refer to the files in this directory during the first slice of development of your new app. 

Later, feel free to delete the bootstrap docs from the new app's repo and rely on your AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md file.
